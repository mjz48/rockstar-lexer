# rockstar-lexer
Learn how to write a lexer and how to use the Rockstar programming Language at the same time...

## TODO

* modify console shell so you can enter in newlines (maybe Shift+Enter adds in newline without submitting command?)

* add support for single quotes (i.e. convert <identifier>'s to <identifier><IS> tokens, and remove single quotes in all other contexts)
* add support for proper variable parsing?
* add support for poetic literal, poetic string literal, and poetic constant?
